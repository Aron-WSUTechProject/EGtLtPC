% From Experiment to Report: Dealing with Labs in Python

[Home](index.html)

## Introduction and Motivation

Scientists and engineers deal with data every day in their work. Whether it be test results from an experiment or data collected in the field, they are required to process data and present their analysis in a concise, clean format. This guide seeks to provide information on best practices for handling data in a lab or experiment all the way from data  collection to the final report. To help demonstrate these techniques, some sample data will be provided and worked on at each step. 

## Collecting Data

To be written. Something will go here talking about CSV files and their portability.

## Processing Data

To be written. Something will go here to talk about how to use Python's array tools to do math and operate on data.

## Data Visualization with Matplotlib

To be written. Something detailing a scatter, line, and box-and-whisker plot along with general practices on keeping plots clean.
