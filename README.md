# The Engineer's Guide to Leveraging the Personal Computer

This is a repository for the "Engineer's Guide to Leveraging the Personal Computer". It is intended to provide a set of HTML documents that can be read on all browsers in a portable manner. Over the course of the WSU Spring 2021 semester, I will update this repository with website content. The initial plan is to create an exploratory section on how to deal with data for labs.
